* Note: For some technical reason I could not upload the dataset file using the dedicated button, 
the fastest solution I was able to conjure while deadline was approaching was to include it with 
the code and other files. In order to download the file, please use link under 
the file which says:"Show full version.." by right-clicking --> selecting: "save link as".





* the attached github repo link contains the following files :
- This file (ReamMe.MD)
- TidyMergedSet.txt :  the tidy dataset combined from train and test datasets, 
only including the means and standard deviation fields.
- run_analysis.R: the code that reproduces the resultant dataset: (TidyMeregedSet.txt)
- the code assumes that the original data already downloaded and unzipped into the current 
directory, and it changes the working directory to :"./UCI HAR Dataset"
