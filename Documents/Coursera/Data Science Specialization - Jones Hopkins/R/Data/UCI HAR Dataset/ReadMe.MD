* Note: Due to my very tight scedule I wasn't able to complete section two of the project (Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. )


* the attached github repo link contains the following files :
- This file (ReamMe.MD)
- TidyMergedSet.txt :  the tidy dataset combined from train and test datasets, only including the means and standard deviation fields.
- run_analysis.R: the code that reproduces the resultant dataset: (TidyMeregedSet.txt)
- the code assumes that the original data already downloaded and unzipped into the current  directory, and it changes the working directory to :"./UCI HAR Dataset"
